Introduction to Moose64
=======================

Moose64 is like C but with pretty Horse64 syntax and basic plain OOP,
for maintainable high-performance code.
It's part of the [Horse64](https://horse64.org) ecosystem.

To build Moose64 programs and to manage dependencies, use [horp
](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/docs/Resources.md#horp)
like you would for Horse64 programs. The compiler for Moose64 is [moosec
](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/srcbranch/main/docs/Resources.md#moosec)
and part of the [SDK](
https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/
docs/Resources.md#sdl).
