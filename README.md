Moose64 Programming Language
============================

[**Moose64**](https://m64.horse64.org) is like C but with pretty
Horse64 syntax and basic plain OOP, for maintainable
high-performance code. Uses:

- Simpler than C++, but with usable OOP,

- Approachable for Horse64 coders,

- Great C inter-operability.

**Currently unusable, stay tuned.**


### Useful starting points

- [Check project news](https://horse64.org/#news).

- [Project license](LICENSE.md).

This repository holds the code of the m64 stdlib, which is the m64 standard
library, and its main documentation. The code is officially hosted on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/m64.horse64.org) with a GitHub
mirror. The code of the moosec compiler is part of the `core.horse64.org`
package instead.


Install & Build
---------------

The recommended way to install is [to get the prebuilt Horse64 SDK](
https://horse64.org/get) which includes [the moosec compiler for Moose64](
/docs/Compilation.md).
