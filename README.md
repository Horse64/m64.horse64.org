Morse64 Programming Language
============================

This language is the evil sibling of [Horse64](https://horse64.org),
designed for low-level use cases. It is made to combine well with
Horse64 where needed for performance reasons or for integrating
pre-existing C libraries well.

**Currently unusable, stay tuned.**


### Useful starting points

- [Check project news](https://horse64.org/#news).

- [Project license](LICENSE.md).

This repository holds the code of the m64 stdlib, which is the m64 standard
library, and its main documentation. The code is officially hosted on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/m64.horse64.org) with a GitHub
mirror. The code of the morsec compiler is part of the `core.horse64.org`
package instead.


Install & Build
---------------

The recommended way to install is [to get the prebuilt Horse64 SDK](
https://horse64.org/get) which includes [the morsec compiler for Morse64](
/docs/Compilation.md).
